# aboutme
they/them

hey! im miles, a 19yo individual who has many hobbies. am a naive queer dork!
i currently work at CSIRO in technical services.

my hobbies in coding hit off during high school where I was using visual basic,
during my time I advanced into full understand of CSS, jquery and then onto some javascript to contruct kaleidoscopes for cameras.
i am still seeking myself to learn and have been really interested in ruby lately (and have had a few twitter bots to show for it!)

i also draw, play cs:go a bunch and am an advocate for lgbtqia rights. all my tweets are my own and that alone.
